1) User Story / Gameplay
    a) Describe the gameplay
        - A ball will move across a screen and players will try to get the ball into the other players side
    b) What are the conditions when the game begins?
        - When a player presses a start button, the game will begin
    c) Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
        - The game will end once one player reaches 20 points
    d) What ifs will there be?
        - if the ball goes into the right players side, the left player will get a point. if the ball hits a players wall, the speed will go inverse
2) Visual Game Components:
    a) What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
        - Which will be static? (the board)
            > The points counter

        - Which will be animated? (the box)
            > the walls controlled by the player and the ball
    b) What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
        - positionX, positionY, speedX, speedY, and points
3) Events / Logic
    a) What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
        - there will be mouse clicking events, and keyboard events
    b) How do those events affect the data of the program?
        - the mouse clicking events will help start the game and the keyboard events will move the walls that players will use
    c) For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
